# Country Inflation Analytics

Welcome to the Country Inflation Analytics project! This interactive tool leverages historical data to visualize and analyze the inflation rates of various countries from 1980 to the present. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Polars, this application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring inflation trends and gaining insights into economic patterns over the decades.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilize Streamlit's dynamic capabilities to interact with the data through graphs and charts.
- **Country-wise Analysis**: Drill down into each country's specific inflation data and trends over the years.
- **Historical Data Insights**: Explore how inflation has evolved since 1980 for each country in the dataset.
- **Data-Driven**: Powered by Polars, enjoy fast and efficient data manipulation and analysis.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used for data analysis and application logic.
- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects, used here to create a seamless, interactive web app.
- **Polars**: A blazingly fast DataFrames library implemented in Rust, used for efficient data manipulation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Country Inflation Analytics application up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This project is developed with Python 3.8+, so it is recommended to use a compatible version.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
   git clone https://github.com/l-ehara/analytics-project.git
=======
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/analytics-project.git
>>>>>>> 1195750 (Update README.md)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd analytics-project
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies to keep your project isolated from the rest of your system.

   - Create a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On Unix or MacOS:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

   - Install the dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Running the Application

With the dependencies installed, you can now run the application using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run App.py
```

Navigate to the local web address provided in the terminal to interact with the Country Inflation Analytics application.
